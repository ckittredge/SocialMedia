Steps for getting The Social Network running

1. Ensure that nodejs is installed on your machine
 - The most current version of node js can be found here: https://nodejs.org/download/
 - This will be needed to run the local server and install any necessary packages through npm
 
2. Within terminal or cmd, navigate to the root of the project folder and perform the following commands:
    - npm install
    - npm start
    
3. The server should now be up and running, serving the main page up to http://127.0.0.1:3000
